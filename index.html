    <h1>Why IMF for archival applications?</h1>
    <div id="abstract"><a href="https://www.imfug.com/explainer">IMF</a> is an international standard that simplifies
      the exchange and
      long-term storage of component-based audio-visual archives.</div>

    <h2>The world is moving to component-based workflows</h2>

    <p>
      Workflows are increasingly becoming component-based, where the
      elements of a presentation (audio, video, timed text, etc.) are stored and
      processed individually.
    </p>

    <p>This transition is driven by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the proliferation of localized versions due to worldwide distribution and acquisition</li>

      <li>the multiplication of viewing experiences (living room, mobile, PC, etc.)</li>

      <li>the expanding repertoire of audio-visual essence (access services, immersive sound, HDR, 4K, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Instead of manufacturing and managing a large inventory of individual and independent masters, component-based
      workflows allow deliverables to be assembled just-in-time from available components to match the needs of the recipient.
    </p>

    <h2>IMF organizes loose components</h2>

    <p>IMF simplifies the interchange and storage of component-based audio-visual media:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>it standardizes the storage of components using the MXF file format</li>
      <li>it defines a timeline that uses XML to synchronize components and metadata</li>
      <li>it standardizes a package that allows components to be stored on, and exchanged through, on a wide range
        of mechanism, from tapes to websites</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By standardizing the representation of essence, metadata and timeline, IMF reduces the friction to automation, search,
    exchange and long-term exploitation. By defining a timeline, it ensures that audio-visual essence and metadata remain
    synchronized.</p>

    <p>IMF is well-suited to replace ad hoc systems where the relationship between components is inferred through conventions (file
    name, directory layout, etc.) and where metadata is unstructured.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>IMF supports a wide range of audio-visual essence and metadata</h2>

    <p>Today's IMF implementations support a wide range audio-visual essence, including 8K image, 96
      kHz audio, immersive sound and rich timed text.
    </p>

    <p>IMF can be easily extended with new kinds of audio-visual essence and metadata and such extensions can be standardized or
    remain user-specific. For example, film scanning metadata could be added to the timeline and arbitrary frame rates are possible.
    Similarly, it is possible to introduce additional frame rates with minimal effort.</p>

    <h2>IMF is a worldwide standard with a worldwide community</h2>

    <p>IMF is a worldwide standard developed by <a href="https://www.smpte.org">SMPTE</a>, with applications that cover
      production,
      cinema, broadcast and streaming use cases. It has been continuously maintained since its initial publication in
      2013.</p>

    <p>IMF is also supported by the <a href="https://www.imfug.com">IMF User Group</a>, which is a worldwide community
      of users and implementers.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>IMF is based on proven standards</h2>

    <p>Whenever possible, IMF reuses proven and stable standards, such as <a
        href="https://doi.org/10.5594/SMPTE.ST377-1.2019">MXF</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/">XML</a>, <a
        href="https://doi.org/10.5594/SMPTE.ST2065-1.2012">ACES</a> and <a
        href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.800/en">JPEG 2000</a>.
      This reduces implementation costs and the viability of long-term storage.</p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>IMF has open source and commercial implementations</h2>

    <p>In addition to several <a href="https://www.imfug.com/suppliers/">commercial products and services</a>, IMF is
      supported by
      many <a href="https://www.imfug.com/open-source/">open source projects</a>, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/photon">Photon</a>: validation of IMF packages</li>
