    <h1>Why IMF for archival applications?</h1>
    <div id="abstract"><a href="https://www.imfug.com/explainer">IMF</a> is an international standard that simplifies
      the exchange and
      long-term storage of component-based audio-visual archives.</div>

    <h2>The world is moving to component-based workflows</h2>

    <p>
      Workflows are increasingly becoming component-based, where the
      elements of a presentation (audio, video, timed text, etc.) are stored and
      processed individually.
    </p>

    <p>This transition is driven by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the proliferation of localized versions due to worldwide distribution and acquisition</li>

      <li>the multiplication of viewing experiences (living room, mobile, PC, etc.)</li>

      <li>the expanding repertoire of audio-visual essence (access services, immersive sound, HDR, 4K, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Instead of manufacturing and managing a large inventory of individual and independent masters, component-based
      workflows allow deliverables to be assembled just-in-time from available components to match the needs of the
      recipient.
    </p>

    <h2>IMF organizes loose components</h2>

    <p>IMF simplifies the interchange and storage of component-based audio-visual media:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>it standardizes the storage of components using the MXF file format</li>
      <li>it defines a timeline that uses XML to synchronize components and metadata</li>
      <li>it standardizes a package that allows components to be stored on, and exchanged through, on a wide range
        of mechanism, from tapes to websites</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By standardizing the representation of essence, metadata and timeline, IMF reduces the friction to automation,
      search,
      exchange and long-term exploitation. By defining a timeline, it ensures that audio-visual essence and metadata
      remain
      synchronized.</p>

    <p>IMF is well-suited to replace ad hoc systems where the relationship between components is inferred through
      conventions (file
      name, directory layout, etc.) and where metadata is unstructured.</p>

      <h2>IMF works in the core or edge of an archive system</h2>

      <p>IMF can be used solely on the edge of an archive system, i.e. as a means of exchanging content in and out of the system.
      This allows the archive system to achieve consistent delivery and meet business requirements, while using its own internal
      storage and data models. These models can support legacy file formats or data models that go beyond that of IMF.</p>

      <p>IMF can also be used within the archive system, as a long-term storage format or as the basis for the data
        model of the archive.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>IMF supports a wide range of audio-visual essence and metadata</h2>

        <p>Today's IMF implementations support a wide range audio-visual essence, including 8K image, 96
          kHz audio, immersive sound and rich timed text.
        </p>

        <p>IMF can be easily extended with new kinds of audio-visual essence and metadata and such extensions can be
          standardized or
          remain user-specific. For example, film scanning metadata could be added to the timeline and arbitrary frame
          rates are possible.
          Similarly, it is possible to introduce additional frame rates with minimal effort.</p>

        <h2>IMF is a worldwide standard with a worldwide community</h2>

        <p>IMF is a worldwide standard developed by <a href="https://www.smpte.org">SMPTE</a>, with applications that
          cover
          production,
          cinema, broadcast and streaming use cases. It has been continuously maintained since its initial publication
          in
          2013.</p>

        <p>IMF is also supported by the <a href="https://www.imfug.com">IMF User Group</a>, which is a worldwide
          community
          of users and implementers.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>IMF is based on proven standards</h2>

        <p>Whenever possible, IMF reuses proven and stable standards, such as <a
            href="https://doi.org/10.5594/SMPTE.ST377-1.2019">MXF</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/">XML</a>, <a
            href="https://doi.org/10.5594/SMPTE.ST2065-1.2012">ACES</a> and <a
            href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.800/en">JPEG 2000</a>.
          This reduces implementation costs and the viability of long-term storage.</p>

        <h2>IMF has open source and commercial implementations</h2>

        <p>In addition to several <a href="https://www.imfug.com/suppliers/">commercial products and services</a>, IMF
          is
          supported by
          many <a href="https://www.imfug.com/open-source/">open source projects</a>, including:</p>
